# AES--Rijindael-Animation
This AES Encryption Implementation project is an exploration into understanding the operations that are isolated to completing AES 128 crypto-scheme. I've followed the animation and programed the sequential steps that are demonstrated in the Rijndael animation.


### **AES Tutorial**

1. If this is your first time programming I strongly suggest taking a basic course in C programming such as 
    https://www.hackerrank.com/ 
3. Once completed watch this playlist on someone implementing AES that can give a deeper understanding to AES as a beginner

5. This is the website that contains the AES animation I followed along while I  programmed  
     https://formaestudio.com/rijndaelinspector/archivos/Rijndael_Animation_v4_eng-html5.html
7. The code will run just copy & paste into any compiler for C programming *happy crypto*
